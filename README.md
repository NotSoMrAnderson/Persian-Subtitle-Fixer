---
## Todo List
- [ ] rework ui widgets tree
- [ ] fix the issue with incompatible file encodings (such as utf-16)
- [ ] find a way to reduce exe size
- [ ] adding folder support to drag & drop
- [ ] write an output log after the process finished for tracking of the files that were not supported, either due to the format problem or app malfunctioning (or maybe just showing an dialog error containing failed files names)
